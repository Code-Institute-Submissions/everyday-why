              I share a lot of my processes with my wife who is a researcher and

              Sometimes, I find new understanding in my son. <br />

                        Someone asked a question.

                          >âWhy does an apple drop from a tree and not go

                        This singular question resulted in todayâs knowledge
                        about gravity. Similarly, questions have been asked and
                        today we can boldly say, âthe earth is round and not
                        flatâ. Questions have also led to the knowledge of
                        present times: electricity, computers, travel, food,
                        drinks, games, and lots more.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So, letâs think for a second, if these questions were
                        never asked, the great limitations the world may have
                        faced. Now also think, if everyone asked a question, how
                        much more advancements we would have.

                        Questions come in different forms but reach for the same
                        goal â enlightenment. We ask because we do not know, we
                        ask because we want to know. We may not ask for the fear
                        of being mocked, or uncertainty about what questions are
                        considered right or wrong. It may be an avoidance of
                        being intimidated, or simply, the overconfidence that
                        âwe know it allâ. But there is no such thing as a dumb
                        question. What makes a question intelligent or stupid?
                        The person who is asking? The content of the Question?
                        The one who is being asked? The same thing that makes a
                        question intelligent is also what makes it stupid. You
                        ask because you do not know and what I know is not what
                        you know. Hence, what may seem a stupid question to me,
                        may just be intelligent to you. So, what then? Ask! You
                        want to get better? You need to understand? Thatâs the
                        beauty of a question.

                        Who we are is more important than what we do. Hence, our

                        Time is Manâs tool for measuring progress. For this
                        reason, at the beginning of every new period, it is a
                        rational prompting to assess and adjust certain portions
                        of existence, to conform to either societally acceptable
                        standards or personal notions of right and wrong.
                        However, very often, the motivation behind the resolve
                        is not sufficient to go the long haul. Then, time
                        elapses and reality sets in. It becomes difficult to
                        carry through till the end. DISCOURAGED, the process is
                        halted until the cycle begins... allâ¦ over... again.
                        *Sigh*

                      <p>
                        In the Words of the Sage Lemuel: "Endings are better
                        than Beginnings; it is better to finish something than
                        to start it.â Let us consider the following thoughts:
                        Perfection - an unattainable place with seeming
                        attainability. We all do strive to attain perfection,
                        but do we ever consider that our best only remains our
                        best until weâre willing to give it that little bit
                        extra? Every journey has an end just as it has a
                        beginning; progress along that journey is unique to the
                        traveller.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Identity, Origin, and Destination determine the
                        journey characteristics, speed, progress and measurement
                        milestones. We are not all heading for the same place,
                        so we cannot measure progress by anotherâs milestones.
                        Thinking about the destination prior to commencing the
                        journey helps to maintain the focus. However, detailed
                        pictures of both the end and the beginning are
                        insufficient without the BEING. These three are
                        intertwined and need to be the bedrock of that
                        resolution. The End - Destination, the Beginning -
                        Origin and the Being â Identity. You can be all you want
                        to be and that is The Creatorâs desire for you.

                        What is man's true identity? To answer this question, we
                        need stillness of the mind, focus on the dynamics of
                        life and living, and silent childlike honesty. Man is a
                        rational being, his Creator made him that way. Rational
                        thinking is essential for mortal existence ONLY.
                        Therefore, it is understandable why the search for his
                        meaning remains persistent and has endured for so many
                        years. So many theories his mind conjures, it must feel
                        really tiresome each time he tries to explain with
                        reason, a concept that itself pre-exists reasoning. Man
                        was created before rational reasoning began, therefore
                        his existence is not within the confines of rationality.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Theories abound on manâs identity, origin and
                        destination. Of them all, NONE stand true. Whether man
                        believes now or at the point of death, is not a function
                        of the head, but a function of the heart. How does a
                        creation fathom the details of its making without a
                        Creator? The only way is trust: faith might sound
                        ambiguous or unreachable to the rational mind, but trust
                        is easier to accept. Let he who recalls the details of
                        his creation doubt the existence of his Creator. Then
                        God said, âAnd now we will make human beings; they will
                        be like us and resemble us. They will have power over
                        the fish, the birds, and all animals, domestic and wild,
                        large and small.â Indeed from the dust of the ground was
                        man formed, moulded, like clay before a Potter, Manâs
                        purpose and Identity are tied solely, completely and
                        unquestionably to the intention of the potter. Your
                        Identity is a function of accepting and believing the
                        unseen. Only in DEATH does man realise his identity and
                        that of his Creator without believing the
                        unseenâ¦unfortunately that may be too late. DO YOU REALLY
                        WANT TO WAIT THAT LONG?

                        Everything has a beginning, an ORIGIN! The source of a
                        spring is greater than its force or flow, for without
                        that source, the spring ceases to exist. The waters may
                        linger, but someday it will dry up. For every existence,
                        there was a reason, but we always strive to be better.
                        Better than what? Whatâs the standard? The richest man
                        that ever lived? Or the most influential one? The
                        biggest inventor? Or the meekest in spirit? How do we
                        realise the proper standard? That âbetterâ that we seek.
                        Are we ever going to hit the âbetterâ mark? Talk less of
                        the âbestâ. So why do we ever try? Why bother? There Is
                        something within man, that seeks something greater, that
                        seeks to know essence. That quest has brought about many
                        different explanations; traditions, theories, beliefsâ¦
                        some with unknown origins. Yetâ¦yesâ¦yetâ¦the answer is
                        right within it, within itâ¦yes within that something.

                        "For ever since the world was created, people have seen
                        the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can
                        clearly see his invisible qualities--his eternal power
                        and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not

                        ATHEISM, AGNOSTICISM AND MID-LIFE CRISIS<br />
                        A strong foothold for atheism and all rational
                        oppositions to Godâs existence is the theory of
                        evolution. Evolution is a THEORY, and rightly well
                        named. It is nothing more than an idea used to account
                        for manâs existence. However, as explained in the
                        "IDENTITY" article, all rational basis to explain manâs
                        identity, origin or destination is indeed the
                        inappropriate way to go. Carbon-14 dating is the
                        backbone of all of evolutionâs postulations and
                        scientific research has proven that it is in itself
                        riddled with inaccuracies. A quick internet search would
                        yield detailed findings to this effect. Atheism is a
                        deeply analytical rationalisation of manâs existence.
                        Indeed, a thorough analysis of the belief system in
                        atheism only shows a need to understand, and an equal
                        and opposite refusal to accept the truth that man could
                        not have come from A PIECE OF SLIME. There is a homing
                        device in man that yearns for its source; everyone knows
                        that there is a God. The real question is how much of
                        him we are willing to accept.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Agnosticism agrees that God exists, but purports that
                        nothing is known or can be known about God's nature.
                        This is a venture into oblivion and a desire to exist in
                        a presumed bliss of incognisance. (Hence, the fallacy,
                        âwhat you donât know, wonât kill youâ). There are
                        replete reasons to know the reason for our being, to
                        succumb to that constant itch deep within the recesses
                        of our person. Majority of people in todayâs world
                        arrive at a place mentally and emotionally where these
                        questions are thrust upon them, owing to the monotony of
                        their existence. "Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the
                        teacher.

                      <p>
                        "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.â <br />

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The above thought is in today's world a common
                        denominator with mid-life crisis. It is yet another
                        quest to understand, to know from where we have come and
                        why. We are inventions of the Great Potter; our bodies
                        are mere shells containing the essence of who we really
                        are. We are not bound to the terrestrial. We cannot be.
                        Thereâs more. Thereâs so much more. You know it and I
                        know it. Where do we go from hereâ¦do not despair, we
                        will find answers together.

                      <p>
                        Now with an understanding of manâs Identity and Origin,
                        We have a clearer realisation that
                        <kbd>man was created.</kbd>
                        That creation resides within the figure we see. He is
                        the man inside and is in possession of the mind. And
                        there was a plan for that creation. But things changed.
                        He decided on a simple experiment that changed the
                        course of history, and as all experiments go, he reaped
                        a consequence; a consequence in his body, what we call
                        Death.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then he began a journey of forever with a contamination
                        in him, passed down from generation to generation. All
                        who were born of blood and have been born of blood,
                        bearing in themselves the result of a singular failed
                        experimental decision, reproducing of their kind with
                        the same restrictions and burdens, a repercussion of his
                        experiment (SIN).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        His family, their families and even more families led
                        along the same route. Man on his own self- constructed
                        path, A diversion from the original plan. Man was
                        designed to take dominion.

                      <p>
                        âBe fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern
                        it.â <br /><mark>Genesis 1 | 28</mark>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Decadence came because of sin, even so every pain,
                        injustice and wrongdoing, disaster, disease and
                        disorder, and then death.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But death is not the end. It cannot be the end. What we
                        call death is a bodily consequence. Man, the creation,
                        lives in a body but exists with or without it. The
                        assumption that death is the end is a product of a
                        rational mind trying to explain a concept that postdates
                        its cessation. Death marks the point when existence in
                        the physical realm ceases, the point when the creation
                        letâs go of the figure that kept him, Then he continues
                        the already started journey, the journey of forever.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        There is no beginning without an end. Creation is the
                        beginning. So what is the end? What is the point for
                        manâs existence? Knowing the end determines the
                        expectancy, the anticipation. Luxury or suffering?
                        Beauty or horror? Which do you anticipate? There is a
                        place of beauty to be anticipated. However, there is a
                        choice to be made. A Choice that will influence the way
                        you see the world and everything in it. There is Hope
                        for the future, you have something to anticipate.

                        What are you thinking about? What do you see concerning
                        the future? Hope is creative imagination. Life on earth
                        is man's beginning, there is an end. The outcome of that
                        end is directly linked to our imagination. Patience is
                        linked with hope; patience is linked to your
                        imagination.

                        Imagination is the forming of a mental image of
                        something not present.

                        For I know the plans I have for you," says the LORD.
                        "They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give
                        you a future and a hope."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A different rendition puts it this way:<br />
                        For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith
                        the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give
                        you an expected end. <mark>Jeremiah 29 | 11</mark>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A positive imagination is clearly contrasted with a
                        negative imagination. God expects us to anticipate the
                        end from beginning, to have positive imaginations about
                        the future He desires to bring us into. Three things
                        will last foreverâfaith, hope, and loveâand the greatest
                        of these is love. <br /><mark
                          >1 Corinthians 13 | 13</mark
                        >
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Hope is greater than faith. Second only to love. The
                        Bible in several places links understanding to
                        imagination. The understanding of a subject is directly
                        linked to the ability to see in the mind that which is
                        to be understood. Studying without imagining the
                        situations and content leaves the reader with nothing
                        but verbal recitations and nothing retained in the
                        heart.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So, what role does this play in our future. Hope must be
                        associated with imagination, mental pictures of the end
                        that is desired. And, a step further, endeavour to bring
                        that imagination before your eyes. See it. The
                        importance of this cannot be overemphasized. Imagination
                        is a process that can either be positive or negative.
                        The Bible repeatedly talks about the dangers of wrong
                        imagination. This is so important, because the mind
                        never stays blank. It always fills itself with content.
                        You want to be a success? You want to make progress?
                        This is Step 1. Hope, positive imagination. Faith is the
                        substance of things HOPED for. This implies that Faith
                        cannot exist without Hope. Without Faith it is
                        impossible to please God. Therefore, without Hope it is
                        impossible to please God.

                        Everyone living in fear, wondering what the next big
                        news will be. Yet we hold on to the information like a
                        lifesaver, seeking to be aware, should we get trapped.

                        Society needs trust because it is increasingly operating
                        at the edge between confidence in what is known from
                        everyday experience, and contingency of new
                        possibilities. Trust is believing but relating to the
                        future; believing in what is to come. Trust is a measure
                        of belief in the honesty, fairness or benevolence of the
                        trusted, to abandon control. So indeed, trust comes with
                        a lot of expectancy.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So in what do we trust?<br />
                        In fact, we actually do trust several things. We eat
                        trusting it will be digested, sleep trusting we will
                        wake, talk trusting we will be listened to, read
                        trusting we will understand and many more. However, most
                        often we trust in the abilities and potency of what we
                        see or hear. We trust the media, the news around us,
                        leading to a lot of negative emotions - anxiety,
                        depression, fear etc. But trust is believing in what we
                        cannot see (or hear), the values of what we are yet to
                        see. Trust is believing in the ability of the unseen.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So why not seek something more uplifting to trust? Why
                        not look on the brighter side, feed on positive
                        information? Or is that just a mirage, outrightly
                        impossible? Is there really any good in the world? Any
                        positive thing to feed on? Of course, there is a lot of
                        good in the world, in fact beneficial to life. Fixing
                        our thoughts on the positive side of things is not to
                        shy away from reality but to be imaginative about the
                        existing possibilities of surviving through the
                        negativism all around. This good news exists even in the
                        media to spur our minds onto a world of possibilities.
                        It's not just a "cock and bull" story to get people
                        excited. It's not the mere opposite of negative
                        information, it has even deeper meanings and values. It
                        can help to even bring out deep and hidden treasures in
                        the heart, the very best of them. It brings about more
                        positive emotions than fathomable.

                      <p>
                        Itâs more worthwhile and wholesome to fix our gaze on
                        positivity. It revitalises, it rejuvenates. Godâs word
                        is full of positivity. But we struggle to believe what
                        it says, about us and about the world.

                        Why do we find it easier to believe the reports in the
                        media as opposed to what we see and hear in Godâs word?
                        Is it because we do not see the one who gives us the
                        promises? FAITH has been mystified and subsequently
                        explained from a much esoteric viewpoint. There is
                        something within the soul of man, that responds to
                        information by trusting, believing and developing
                        increased confidence in what he consistently hears.
                        Faith is Trust. Faith is Confidence. Faith is not
                        mysterious. Faith is not reserved for an elect. Faith is
                        not a feeling. Every man with a functional assimilation
                        of information can have faith in that which he hears.

                      <p>
                        "Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will
                        actually happen; it gives us assurance about things we
                        cannot see.â <br /><mark>Hebrews 11 | 1</mark>

                      <p>
                        We have looked at Hope as positive imagination. This
                        type of Imagination cannot be separated from the
                        information we think on. The Bible says, "...one final
                        thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable,
                        and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think
                        about things that are excellent and worthy of
                        praise.â<br />

                      <p>
                        Little wonder, the subject of Faith is such a
                        mystery.<br />
                        Reclusion socially or mentally has been associated with
                        religious icons. The reason for this is simple, the
                        vastness of negativity in the world, opposes the very
                        concept of Faith, literally confusing the heart of Man.
                        Learning to trust God through it all comes with more
                        peace and less negative emotions. As we keep aware of
                        the happenings around the world, letâs remember what God
                        says about it all; "â¦cast your cares upon me for I care
                        for youâ¦ take my yoke upon you...for my burden is easy
                        and my yoke is light." Weâre safer resting in that
                        place. This is Faith.

                        way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of
                        being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but
                        rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives
                        up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures
                        through every circumstance.â <br /><mark

                        write-up. But letâs think about it in the simplest terms
                        we can relate with. Itâs all about showing that we truly
                        care, from deep within our hearts. Itâs not a fake or
                        falsified appearance, or pretence as we may call it. It
                        is more reliable, a phenomenon that can be replicated in
                        any circumstance. Think about it in any and every
                        respect, love remains love in every situation.

                        It is the little efforts we put in every day to make the
                        world a better place. Just observing that there is a
                        need, or that something can be done differently to make
                        it better, or that someone can be better, thinking about
                        these and taking that little step to make a change,
                        without being rash or degrading.

                        WOW! How precious love is. Love is sharing what you have
                        with those around you. It is seeking the best of the
                        next person without selfish intentions. It lights up the
                        world around you. Even by simply sharing a honest
                        thought. It radiates, it is reaching the world around
                        you. Love is being âthat shoulder to lean onâ. Selah

                        Just being able to show that we care is all that matters
                        - that we care now and we always will. The same the
                        master did, showing the perfect example, He cared, still
                        cares and always will.

                        There is no greater love than to lay down oneâs life for
                        oneâs friends.<br />

                        Love is the character of God. Love is the motivation
                        that made the world. When and only when we learn to see
                        through the eyes of love are we put on a path of
                        consistent happiness, fulfilment and purpose.

                        <kbd>Question:</kbd><br />
                        Is it possible to show love to someone who obviously is
                        not willing to accept love?
