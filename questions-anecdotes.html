              Hi, my name is Rex and Iâm a creative. <br />

              But most of all, I am a Christian. <br />
              I have a curious mind, I strive to understand, 
              and so I ask a lot of questions.<br />
              I ask, then research, then talk, then ask again, 
              then research and then discuss until I find answers. <br />
              I share a lot of my processes with my wife who is
              a researcher and often helps my process. <br />
              Sometimes, I find new understanding in my son. <br />
              This is a personal diary into my questions about life. <br />
              I think of simple ways to interpret lifeâs concepts,

                        Someone asked a question.

                        singular question resulted in todayâs knowledge about
                        gravity. Similarly, questions have been asked and today
                        we can boldly say, The Earth is round and not flat.
                        Questions have also led to the knowledge of present
                        times: Electricity, computers, Travel (jets), food,
                        drinks, games, and lots more. Letâs think for a second,
                        If these questions were never asked, The great
                        limitations the world may have faced. Now also think, if
                        everyone asked a question. How much more advancements we
                        would have.

                          curiosity of the mind Or the inquisitiveness of

                        These and more drive questions. Questions come in
                        different forms, But reach for the same goal â
                        Enlightenment. We ask because we do not know, We ask
                        because we want to know. We may not ask for the fear of
                        being mocked, Or uncertainty about what questions may be
                        right or wrong. It may be an avoidance of being
                        intimidated, Or simply, the overconfidence that âwe know
                        it allâ. There is no such thing as a dumb question. What
                        makes a Question intelligent or stupid? The person whoâs
                        asking? The content of the Question? Or the one whoâs
                        being asked? The same thing that makes a Question
                        intelligent Is also what makes it stupid. You ask
                        because you do not know And what I know is not what you
                        know. Hence, what may seem a stupid question to me, May
                        just be intelligent to you. So what then? Ask! You want
                        to get better? You need to understand? Thatâs the beauty
                        of a Question. Better to look stupid for 5 minutes Than
                        remain stupid for a lifetime.

                        We are not human doings but human beings. Who we are is
                        more important than what we do. Hence, our personality
                        drives our actions. This implies that focusing on
                        changing a behaviour or set of actions, Has never proven
                        to be a freeway to primeness. Time is Manâs tool for
                        measuring progress. For this reason, at the beginning of
                        every new period, It is a rational prompting to assess
                        and adjust certain portions of existence To conform to
                        either societally acceptable standards Or personal
                        notions of right and wrong. However, very often, the
                        motivation behind the resolve Is not sufficient to go
                        the long haul. Then, time elapses and reality sets in.
                        It becomes difficult to carry through till the end.
                        DISCOURAGED, the process is halted Until the cycle
                        begins... allâ¦ over... again. *Sighs* In the Words of
                        the Sage Lemuel: "Endings are better than Beginnings; it
                        is better to finish something than to start it.â Letâs
                        consider the following thoughts: Perfection - an
                        unattainable place with seeming attainability. We all do
                        strive to attain perfection but do we ever consider that
                        our best only remains our best until weâre willing to
                        give it that little bit extra? Every journey has an End
                        just as it has a Beginning; progress along that journey
                        is peculiar to the traveller. The Identity, Origin, and
                        Destination determine the journey characteristics,
                        speed, progress and measurement milestones. We are not
                        all heading for the same place, hence we can not measure
                        progress by anotherâs milestones. Thinking about the
                        destination prior to commencing the journey helps to
                        maintain the focus. However, detailed pictures of both
                        the End and the Beginning are insufficient without the
                        BEING. These three are intertwined and need to be the
                        bedrock of that resolution. The End - Destination, the
                        Beginning - Origin and the Being - Identity.

                        Dictionary) Questions Enlighten. Questions Equip.
                        Questions, when asked rightly ensure minimal errors.
                        What is Man's True Identity? To answer this question we
                        need stillness of the mind, focus on the dynamics of
                        life and living, and silent childlike honesty. WHO AM
                        I?: A SUPERNATURAL CONUNDRUM Man is a rational being,
                        his Creator made him that way. Rational thinking is
                        essential for mortal existence ONLY. Therefore it is
                        understandable why the search for his meaning remains
                        persistent and has endured for so many years. So many
                        theories his mind conjures, it must feel really tiresome
                        each time he tries to explain with reason, a concept
                        that itself pre-exists reasoning. Man was created before
                        Rational Reasoning began, therefore his existence is not
                        within the confines of Rationality. Theories abound on
                        Manâs Identity, Origin and Destination. Of them all,
                        NONE stand true. Whether Man believes now or at the
                        point of Death, is not a function of the Head, but a
                        function of the Heart. How does a Creation fathom the
                        details of itâs making without a Creator? The Only way
                        is Trust: Faith might sound ambiguous or unreachable to
                        the rational mind, but Trust is easier to accept. Let he
                        who recalls the details of his creation doubt the
                        existence of his Creator. Then God said, âAnd now we
                        will make human beings; they will be like us and
                        resemble us. They will have power over the fish, the
                        birds, and all animals, domestic and wild,large and
                        small.â Indeed from the dust of the ground was man
                        formed, moulded, like Clay before a Potter, Manâs
                        purpose and Identity are tied solely, completely and
                        unquestionably to the intention of the Potter. Your
                        Identity is a function of accepting and believing the
                        Unseen. Only in DEATH does Man realise his Identity and
                        that of his Creator without believing the
                        Unseenâ¦unfortunately that maybe too late. DO YOU REALLY
                        WANT TO WAIT THAT LONG? Question for the Week What is
                        Trust?

                        Everything has a beginning, an ORIGIN! The source of a
                        spring is greater than its force or flow, For without
                        that source, the spring ceases to exist. The waters may
                        linger, but someday it will dry up. For every existence,
                        there was a reason, but we always strive to be better.
                        Better than what? Whatâs the standard? The richest man
                        that ever lived? Or the most influential one? The
                        biggest inventor? Or the meekest in spirit? How do we
                        realise the proper standard? That better that we seek.
                        Are we ever going to hit the âbetterâ mark? Talk less of
                        the âbestâ. So why do we ever try? Why bother? Thereâs
                        something within man, that seeks something greater, that
                        seeks to know essence. That quest has brought about many
                        different explanations; traditions, theories, beliefsâ¦
                        some with unknown origins. Yetâ¦yesâ¦yetâ¦the answer is
                        right within it, Within itâ¦yes within that something.
                        "For ever since the world was created, people have seen
                        the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can
                        clearly see his invisible qualities--his eternal power
                        and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not
                        knowing God.â - Romans 1:20 ATHEISM, AGNOSTICISM AND
                        MID-LIFE CRISIS A strong foothold for Atheism and all
                        rational oppositions to Godâs existence is the theory of
                        Evolution. Evolution is a THEORY, and rightly well
                        named. It is nothing more than an idea used to account
                        for manâs existence. However, as explained in the
                        "IDENTITY" article, all rational basis to explain Manâs
                        Identity, Origin or Destination is indeed the
                        inappropriate way to go. Carbon-14 dating is the
                        backbone of all of Evolutionâs postulations and
                        scientific research has proven that it is in itself
                        riddled with inaccuracies. A quick google search would
                        yield detailed findings to this effect. Atheism is a
                        deeply analytical rationalisation of manâs existence.
                        Indeed a thorough analysis of the belief system in
                        atheism only shows a need to understand, and an equal
                        and opposite refusal to accept the truth that man could
                        not have come from A PIECE OF SLIME. There is a homing
                        device in man that yearns for itâs source; every one
                        knows that there is a God. The real question is how much
                        of him we are willing to accept. Agnosticism agrees that
                        God exists, but purports that nothing is known or can be
                        known about God's nature. This is a venture into
                        Oblivion and a desire to exist in a presumed bliss of
                        incognisance. (Hence, the fallacy, âwhat you donât know,
                        wonât kill youâ). There are replete reasons to know the
                        reason for our being, to succumb to that constant itch
                        deep within the recesses of our person. Majority of
                        people in todayâs world arrive at a place mentally and
                        emotionally where these questions are thrust upon them,
                        owing to the monotony of their existence. "Meaningless!
                        Meaningless!" says the teacher. "Utterly meaningless!
                        Everything is meaningless.â -Ecclesiastes 1:2 The above
                        thought is in today's world a common denominator with
                        Mid-Life Crisis. It is yet another quest to understand,
                        To know from where we have come and why. We are
                        Inventions of the Great Potter, our bodies are mere
                        shells containing the essence of who we really are. We
                        are not bound to the terrestrial. We cannot be. Thereâs
                        more. Thereâs so much more. You know it and I know it.
                        Where do we go from hereâ¦do not despair we will find
                        answers together.

                      <p>
                        Now with an understanding of manâs Identity and Origin,
                        We have a clearer realisation that
                        <kbd>man was created.</kbd>
                        That creation resides within the figure we see. He is
                        the man inside and is in possession of the mind. And
                        there was a plan for that creation. But things changed.
                        He decided on a simple experiment that changed the
                        course of history And as all experiments go, he reaped a
                        consequence. A consequence in his body, what we call
                        Death. Then he began a journey of forever with a
                        contamination in him, Passed down from generation to
                        generation. All who were born of blood and have been
                        born of blood, Bearing in themselves the result of a
                        singular failed experimental decision, Reproducing of
                        their kind with the same restrictions and burdens, A
                        repercussion of his experiment (SIN). His family, their
                        families and even more families led along the same
                        route. Man on his own self- constructed path, A
                        diversion from the original plan. Man was designed to
                        take dominion. âBe fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth
                        and GOVERN it.â - Genesis 1:28 Decadence came because of
                        sin, Even so every pain, injustice and wrongdoing,
                        disaster, disease and disorder, And then death. But
                        Death is not the end. It cannot be the end. What we call
                        Death is a Bodily consequence. Man, the creation, lives
                        in a body but exists with or without it. The assumption
                        that death is the end is a product of a rational mind
                        trying to explain a concept that postdates its
                        cessation. Death marks the point when existence in the
                        physical realm ceases, The point when the creation letâs
                        go of the figure that kept him, Then he continues the
                        already started journey, the journey of forever. There
                        is no beginning without an end. Creation is the
                        beginning. So what is the end? What is the point for
                        manâs existence? Knowing the end determines the
                        expectancy, the anticipation. Luxury or suffering?
                        Beauty or horror? Which do you anticipate? There is a
                        place of beauty to be anticipated. However there is a
                        choice to be made. A Choice that will influence the way
                        you see the world and everything in it. There is Hope
                        for the future, you have something to anticipate.

                        I look ahead My Heart is set on the prize. The Shiny
                        Gold-mounded cup, I have dreamt of this for so long. All
                        the practice and training sessions, the sleepless
                        nights, the endless self denial. The time is now (Heart
                        Beats faster, a feeling of warmness runs through his
                        body) I can win this. I am the swiftest. I can feel the
                        medal around my neck. Yes I can and I will. (Gun shot
                        sound as runners take off towards the finish line) The
                        above is an excerpt from a typified account of a runner
                        just before the race begins. The determination to go
                        beyond seeming limitations is linked to your
                        imagination. Your anticipation. What are you thinking
                        about? What do you see concerning the future. Hope is
                        creative imagination. Life on earth is Man's beginning,
                        there is an end. The outcome of that end is directly
                        linked to our imagination. Patience is linked with Hope
                        Patience is linked to your imagination. Imagination is
                        the forming of a mental image of something not present.
                        For I know the plans I have for you," says the LORD.
                        "They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give
                        you a future and a hope. A different rendition put's it
                        this way: For I know the thoughts that I think toward
                        you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil,
                        to give you an expected end. -Jeremiah 29:11 A positive
                        imagination is clearly contrasted with a negative
                        imagination. God expects us to anticipate the end from
                        beginning. To have positive imaginations about the
                        future He desires to bring us into. Three things will
                        last foreverâfaith, hope, and loveâand the greatest of
                        these is love. -1 Corinthians 13:13 Hope is greater than
                        faith. Second only to love. The Bible in several places
                        links understanding to imagination. The understanding of
                        a subject is directly linked to the ability to see in
                        the mind that which is to be understood. Studying
                        without imagining the situations and content leaves the
                        reader with nothing but verbal recitations and nothing
                        retained in the heart. So what role does this play in
                        our future. Hope must be associated with imagination,
                        mental pictures of the end that is desired. And, a step
                        further, endeavour to bring that imagination before your
                        eyes. See it. The importance of this cannot be
                        overemphasized. Imagination is a process that can either
                        be positive or negative. The Bible repeatedly talks
                        about the dangers of wrong imagination. This is so
                        important, because the mind never stays blank. It always
                        fills itself with content. You want to be a success, you
                        want to make progress. This is Step 1. Hope, positive
                        imagination. Faith is the substance of things HOPED for.
                        This implies that Faith cannot exist without Hope.
                        Without Faith it is impossible to please God. Therefore
                        without Hope it is impossible to please God.

                        And in fact look forward to hearing the next new thing.
                        âThereâs something new in the news, have you heard? All
                        these things going on in the worldâ, we often hear.
                        Everyone living in fear, wondering what the next big
                        news will be. Yet we hold on to the information like a
                        life-saver. Seeking to be aware, should we get trapped.
                        Society needs trust because it is increasingly operating
                        at the edge between confidence in what is known from
                        everyday experience, and contingency of new
                        possibilities. Trust is believing but relating to the
                        future. Believing in what is to come. Trust is a measure
                        of belief in the honesty, fairness or benevolence of the
                        trusted, to abandon control. So indeed, trust comes with
                        a lot of expectancy. So in what do we trust? In fact, we
                        actually do trust several things We eat trusting it will
                        be digested, sleep trusting we will wake, talk trusting
                        we will be listened to, read trusting we will understand
                        and many more. However, most often we trust in the
                        abilities and potency of what we see or hear. We trust
                        the media, the news around us, leading to a lot of
                        negative emotions - anxiety, depression, fear etc. But
                        trust is believing in what we cannot see, the values of
                        what we are yet to see. Trust is believing in the
                        ability of the unseen. So why not seek something more
                        uplifting to trust? Why not look on the brighter side,
                        feed on positive information? Or is that just a mirage?
                        Is there really any good in the world? Any positive
                        thing to feed on? Of course there is a lot of good in
                        the world, in fact beneficial to life. Fixing our
                        thoughts on the positive side of things is not to shy
                        away from reality but to be imaginative about the
                        existing possibilities of surviving through the
                        negativism all around. These good news exist even in the
                        media to spur our minds onto a world of possibilities.
                        It's not just a "cock and bull" story to get people
                        excited. It's not the mere opposite of negative
                        information, it has even deeper meanings and values. It
                        can help to even bring out deep and hidden treasures in
                        the heart, the very best of them. It brings about more
                        positive emotions than fathomable. Itâs more worthwhile
                        and wholesome to fix our gaze on positivity. It
                        revitalises, it rejuvenates. Godâs word is full of
                        positivity. But we struggle to believe what it says,
                        about us and about the world. "Here on earth you will
                        have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I
                        have overcome the world." John 16:33 Why do we find it
                        easier to believe the reports in the media as opposed to
                        what we see and hear in Godâs word? Is it because we do
                        not see the one who gives us the promises? FAITH has
                        been mystified and subsequently explained from a much
                        esoteric point of view. There is something within the
                        soul of man, that responds to information by trusting,
                        believing and developing increased confidence in what he
                        consistently hears. Faith is Trust. Faith is Confidence.
                        Faith is not mysterious. Faith is not reserved for an
                        elect. Faith is not a feeling. Every man with a
                        functional assimilation of information can have faith in
                        that which he hears. "Faith is the confidence that what
                        we hope for will actually happen; it gives us assurance
                        about things we cannot see.â -Hebrews 11:1 We have
                        looked at Hope as positive imagination. This type of
                        Imagination cannot be separated from the information we
                        think on. The Bible says "...one final thing. Fix your
                        thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and
                        pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that
                        are excellent and worthy of praise.â -Philippians 4:8
                        Little wonder, the subject of Faith is such a mystery.
                        Reclusion, socially or mentally has been associated with
                        religious icons. The reason for this is simple, the
                        vastness of negativity in the world, opposes the very
                        concept of Faith. Literally confusing the heart of Man.
                        Learning to trust God through it all comes with more
                        peace and less negative emotions. As we keep aware of
                        the happenings around the world, letâs remember what God
                        says about it all. "â¦cast your cares upon me for I care
                        for youâ¦ take my yoke upon you...for my burden is easy
                        and my yoke is light." Weâre safer resting in that
                        place. This is Faith. "THINK SENSIBLY, as God has
                        distributed a measure of faith(trust) to each one.â

                      <p>
                        Weâve all heard that:
                        <kbd
                          >âLove is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or
                          boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own
                          way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of
                          being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but
                          rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives
                          up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures
                          through every circumstance.â -1 Corinthians
                          13:4-6</kbd
                        >
                        So what exactly is this LOVE? Thereâs no doubt that the
                        concept of love involves a vast number of ingredients
                        that can hardly be covered in a single write-up. But
                        letâs think about it in the most simple terms we can
                        relate with. Itâs all about showing that we truly care,
                        from deep within our hearts. Itâs not a fake or
                        falsified appearance, or pretence as we may call it. It
                        is more reliable, a phenomenon that can be replicated in
                        any circumstance. Think about it in any and every
                        respect, love remains love in every situation. Love
                        involves NOTICING, THINKING AND ACTING, not for personal
                        benefits but for another. It is the little efforts we
                        make everyday to make the world a better place. Just
                        observing that there is a need, or that something can be
                        done differently to make it better, or that someone can
                        be better, thinking about these and taking that little
                        step to make a change, without being rash or degrading.
                        WOW! How precious true love is. Love is sharing what you
                        have with those around you. It is seeking the best of
                        the next person without selfish intentions. It lights up
                        the world around you. Even by simply sharing a honest
                        thought. It radiates, it is reaching the world around
                        you. Love is being âthat shoulder to lean onâ. Selah
                        Just being able to show that we care is all that
                        matters. That we care now and we always will. The same
                        the master did, showing the perfect example. He cared,
                        still cares and always will. There is no greater love
                        than to lay down oneâs life for oneâs friends. -John 15:
                        13 Love is the character of God. Love is the motivation
                        that made the world. When and only when we learn to see
                        through the eyes of love are we put on a path of
                        consistent happiness, fulfilment and purpose. QUESTION:
                        Is it possible to show love to someone who obviously is
                        not willing to accept the love?
