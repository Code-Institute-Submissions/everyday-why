EverydayWhy is a passion project that sits at the intersection between a Personal Design Diary and Christian Apologetics. According to Wikipedia, Christian apologetics is a branch of Christian theology that defends Christianity against objections.

As a visual artist I have always struggled with finding subject matter that represents my interests and defines my belief system. I stumbled upon Chrsitian Apologetics and found its focus both exciting and challenging to represent from the eye of a creator. EverydayWhy is born of that desire to represent my thoughts, questions and perceptions about life in a way that would hopefully be of interest to designers, design enthusiasts, christians and all those with similar questions.

As a personal design diary, I also intend to use it as a platform to share my knowledge on my preferred design tools, primarily Side FX Houdini and Adobe After Effects . Knowledge about using Houdini as a design tool isn't so commom place and I feel that it would be a nice addition to make my project files available for download. Also, a future update would be to add a section for tutorials

It is my desire that I can create a hub to share my journey in visual communication, as well as, making an online space that represents my interests and skills, so as to also attract design collaborations and commisions from people with similar interests.

I am grateful for the knowledge I have gained so far on this course as it has enabled create something that was only just an imagination a few months ago.

        <h2><img src="assets/images/Colour-Palette.png"></h2>
    - #### Typography
        -   The Google fonts Libre Franklin and Roboto Mono are the two fonts used across the website with Sans Serif and Monospace as the alternative fonts respectively, for cases when the default options aren't loaded onto the website correctly.
        Both fonts are very legible and contrast nicely together. With Libre Franklin serving as the primary font for headlines and titles and Roboto Mono as the body text. 
    - #### Imagery
        -   Images across the website play a huge role and a created to be analogous to the sites colour palette. 
    - #### Negative Space
        -   Negative Space helps to give the viewer some breathing space between both the images and Article section which typical has a lot of text. 

*   ### Wireframes

    Initial Wireframes developed at the start of the project are <a href="assets/images/RexAbba-AbbaMilestoneProjectWireframe.pdf" download>here.</a> One difference that can be observed is that I decided to make the Downloads & Resources page into the homepage which is now called Gallery. This choice to help easy navigation and provide a more welcoming homepage with appealing images. 

  

## Features

This section contains all the features of the website

### Gallery

This is the homepage and hub for all the images and downloads. Each image has three anchor tags:

- A download link to a high resolution version of the image.
- A download link to the project files and assets used to make the image and
- A link that takes to the user to the related article.

### Questions & Anecdotes

This is a collection of articles on a range of questions, structured with collapsible accordion panels.
Each article is intended to inspire or ignite more questions.

### About

This has a little bit of a bit of information concerning me and the motivation behind the EverydayWhy.

### Say Hello

This page contains features that helps the user make inquiries, sign up for email updates and follow social media handles.
The implementation uses Bootstrap's modal with three main features:

- An inquiry form which allows user to ask questions or send comments by filling out required fields.
- A email field which enables users sign up for a newsletter.
- Icons with links to EverydayWhy's social media platforms.


### Features Left to Implement

- Article archives with indexing will be useful to include as the number of articles increase. This would help the user easily find articles based around keywords. 
- A merchandise section with items connected to articles and branded with themes connected to their images.
- A tutorial section with timelapse or narrated tutorials around the creation of selected Article artwork.
