EverydayWhy is a passion project that sits at the intersection between a Personal Design Diary and Christian Apologetics. According to Wikipedia, Christian apologetics is a branch of Christian theology that defends Christianity against objections. 

As a visual artist I have always struggled with finding subject matter that represents my interests and defines my belief system. I stumbled upon Chrsitian Apologetics and found its focus both exciting and challenging to represent from the eye of a creator. EverydayWhy is born of that desire to represent my thoughts, questions and perceptions about life in a way that would hopefully be of interest to designers, design enthusiasts, christians and all those with similar questions. 

It is my desire that I can create a hub to share my journey in visual communication and spiritual enlightenment. 

I am grateful for the knowledge I have gained so far on this course as it has enabled create something that was only just an imagination a few months ago.
 
## UX  
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
This section contains all the features of the website
### Gallery
This is the homepage and hub for all the images and downloads. Each image has three anchor tags:
- A download link to a high resolution version of the image.
- A download link to the project files and assets used to make the image and
- A link that takes to the user to the related article. 

### Questions & Anecdotes 
This is a collection of articles on a range of questions, structured with collapsible accordion panels. 
Each article is intended to inspire or ignite more questions. 

### About
This has a little bit of a bit of information concerning me and the motivation behind the EverydayWhy. 

### Say Hello
This page contains features that helps the user make inquiries, sign up for email updates and follow social media handles. 
There are three main features on this page:
- An inquiry form which allows user to ask questions or send comments by filling out required fields. 
- A email field which enables users sign up for a newsletter. 
- Icons with links to social EverydayWhy's social media platforms. 

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses Bootstrap's library to simplify responsiveness with mobile devices. 

- [Javascript]
    - The project uses Bootstrap's library to simplify responsiveness with mobile devices. 

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
